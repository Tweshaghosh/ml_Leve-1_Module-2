                        "i own a 2014 fiesta that i bought primarily to tow behind my motorhome.  i\u2019ve owned it for about 3 years. recently while driving with the radio on, i heard a loud \u201cpop\u201d that sounded like something had fallen on the roof.  it was so loud that i instinctively ducked.  since then, i intermittently get the pop, though not as loud, and often static of various noise levels.  sometimes the static appears to be from the front speakers and sometimes from the dash/radio itself.  sometimes there is low static even when the radio is off, and it has happened when using sync with the phone.  i want it fixed but dread having a ford shop search for the cause.  any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
                        "so the fiesta pops, not the motorhome? has the pop only occurred with the radio on? or also off?",
                        "the pop has only happened with the radio on, but other noises (static and crackling) with the radio on or off. this only happens when driving; has nothing to do with the rv.",

                        "audio system popping and cracking is usually caused by a malfunctioning audio system amplifier however a vehicle in this price class would not have a separate amplifier.",
                        "is the radio antenna on top of the car where the initial loud pop and further ongoing pops are occuring?  perhaps there is a problem with the antenna resulting in the issue with the radio when on and ongoing static noise through the speakers even when the radio is off.",
                        "inside the audio system there\u2019s a ribbon connector that\u2019s between the radio and the cd changer part of the audio system, a bad connection there seems to be the source of the noise for focus and fiesta owners of this era. sound\u2019s like most ford dealers don\u2019t know how to fix this but from the forums it just requires someone who knows how to pull the radio and look inside.",

                        "can you post a recording of the noise?  to be safe, you should have a friend come along and make the recording. that might help us understand the issue better. you didn\u2019t mention turning.  do turns generate the noise?  i\u2019d guess not from your initial post, but it\u2019s good the be certain. the reason i ask is that urethane bushings are known to squeak unless they are properly lubricated.",
                        "no , there isn\u2019t any sound on turning .\nthe sound doesn\u2019t come on stanstill so i probably think that rough urethane bushings are unlikely.\ni have discussed the same with many hector owners , none has experienced this noise.\nit sounds like an old hinge of a door.",
                        "i have discussed the same with many hector owners , none has experienced this noise.",
                        "if they used  polyurethane body bushing that may be your problem. while they are a better bushing sometimes they tend to squeak.",
                        "if it was the polyurethane bushings then it would have been on standstill too.\nthe sound is a proper creak like that you get from the hinge of an old/rusted door .\nthere is no squeal.",
                        "they also use  polyurethane bushings on suspension parts like the sway bar for example. and it sounds like a creaking sound. just a thought.",
                        "okay ,\nbut the service centre people as well as the company says that all the parts of suspension are fine.\nthough it could be possible but the thing is that how did the sound go away for 14 days when the subframe screws were retorqued.\nbefore retorqueing them they said that the screws were tight only.",
                        "tightening the bolts and especially lubricated the suspension parts could of quieted it down for a short while but it will come back. go on youtube and search polyurethane bushing squeaks and see  if it sounds like what you have.",
                        "it came back after 14 days , so quickly ? even after greasing\nit doesn\u2019t sound like screeching of polyurethane bushings",
                        "something they greased stopped the problem. if it was me i would start lubing parts one at a time until the noise went away. then you will know where it exactly its coming from."
